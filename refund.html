            <h2>1. Overview</h2>
            <p>KareemDaSilva.com is committed to providing customers with exceptional service. If you are not satisfied with the service provided, we offer a refund policy to ensure customer satisfaction and maintain trust. However, due to the nature of application development and the resources involved, we have specific conditions for refund eligibility.</p>
        
            <h2>2. Deposit Refunds</h2>
            <p>a. Deposits are typically required to initiate the development process. However, we understand that circumstances may change, and therefore, if a project is cancelled before work has begun, a full refund of the deposit will be provided.</p>
        
            <p>b. If a project is cancelled after work has begun but before it reaches the halfway point, 50% of the deposit will be refunded. The retained portion will cover time, resources and other costs incurred during the development process.</p>
        
            <p>c. If a project is cancelled after it has passed the halfway point, the deposit will be non-refundable, to compensate for the resources invested and time spent on the project.</p>
        
            <h2>3. Post-Completion Refunds</h2>
            <p>Once the application is completed and delivered, refunds will not typically be offered as the service has been fully provided. However, we do commit to making necessary amendments within the scope of the original project to ensure customer satisfaction. If you are not satisfied with the final product, we will work with you to make corrections and improvements.</p>
        
            <h2>4. Refunds for Additional Services</h2>
            <p>Additional services such as maintenance, updates, and revisions are non-refundable once they have been completed. Refunds for these services while they are in-progress will be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.</p>
        
            <h2>5. Processing Refunds</h2>
            <p>Eligible refunds will be issued within 30 business days of the refund request. The funds will be returned via the original payment method.</p>
        
            <h2>6. Refund Requests</h2>
            <p>Refund requests should be made in writing and emailed to refunds@kareemdasilva.com. Please include your name, project details, and the reason for your refund request.</p>
        
            <h2>7. Changes to the Refund Policy</h2>
            <p>KareemDaSilva.com reserves the right to modify this refund policy at any time without prior notice. Please check this policy periodically to stay updated.</p>
        
            <p>Your satisfaction is our top priority. If you have any questions or concerns about this refund policy, feel free to contact us. Thank you for considering KareemDaSilva.com for your application development needs.</p>
